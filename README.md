# Eocene

### Marketplace to rent extreme sports equipment
https://eocene698.herokuapp.com/

Noticing a gap in the market for extreme sports equipment, Eocene was created! For the thrill seeker going on a short-term holiday, who will not need the equipment once the holiday is over. Eocene allows people with the equipment to rent to others who need it. Whether you're going on a skiing holiday one week, then paragliding the next; Eocene has you covered!

The website was built during a Le Wagon bootcamp using Ruby, Rails, HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), PostgreSQL and Heroku.
